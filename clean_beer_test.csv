2,Trashy Blonde,You Know You Shouldn't,04/2008,"A titillating, neurotic, peroxide punk of a Pale Ale. Combining attitude, style, substance, and a little bit of low self esteem for good measure; what would your mother say? The seductive lure of the sassy passion fruit hop proves too much to resist. All that is even before we get onto the fact that there are no additives, preservatives, pasteurization or strings attached. All wrapped up with the customary BrewDog bite and imaginative twist.",https://images.punkapi.com/v2/2.png,4.1,41.5,15.0,15.0,4.4,"Maris Otter Extra Pale, Caramalt, Munich Amarillo, Simcoe, Amarillo, Motueka Wyeast 1056 - American Ale™","Fresh crab with lemon, Garlic butter dipping sauce, Goats cheese salad, Creamy lemon bar doused in powdered sugar",Sam Mason,"Maris Otter Extra Pale, Caramalt, Munich","Amarillo, Simcoe, Amarillo, Motueka",Wyeast 1056 - American Ale™

4,Pilsen Lager,Unleash the Yeast Series.,09/2013,"Our Unleash the Yeast series was an epic experiment into the differences in aroma and flavour provided by switching up your yeast. We brewed up a wort with a light caramel note and some toasty biscuit flavour, and hopped it with Amarillo and Centennial for a citrusy bitterness. Everything else is down to the yeast. Pilsner yeast ferments with no fruity esters or spicy phenols, although it can add a hint of butterscotch.",https://images.punkapi.com/v2/4.png,6.3,55.0,30.0,15.0,4.4,"Extra Pale, Caramalt, Dark Crystal, Munich Centennial, Amarillo, Centennial, Amarillo, Centennial, Amarillo Wyeast 2007 - Pilsen Lager™","Spicy crab cakes, Spicy cucumber and carrot Thai salad, Sweet filled dumplings",Ali Skinner,"Extra Pale, Caramalt, Dark Crystal, Munich","Centennial, Amarillo, Centennial, Amarillo, Centennial, Amarillo",Wyeast 2007 - Pilsen Lager™
5,Avery Brown Dredge,Bloggers' Imperial Pilsner.,02/2011,"An Imperial Pilsner in collaboration with beer writers. Tradition. Homage. Revolution.

6,Electric India,Vibrant Hoppy Saison.,05/2013,"Re-brewed as a spring seasonal, this beer – which appeared originally as an Equity Punk shareholder creation – retains its trademark spicy, fruity edge.

7,AB:12,Imperial Black Belgian Ale.,07/2012,"An Imperial Black Belgian Ale aged in old Invergordon Scotch whisky barrels with mountains of raspberries, tayberries and blackberries in each cask. Decadent but light and dry, this beer would make a fantastic base for ageing on pretty much any dark fruit - we used raspberries, tayberries and blackberries beause they were local.",https://images.punkapi.com/v2/7.png,11.2,35.0,80.0,40.0,5.3,"Extra Pale, Chocolate, Carafa Special Malt Type 3 Tomahawk, Magnum, Magnum, Tomahawk, Centennial, Amarillo, Centennial, Amarillo, Tomahawk Wyeast 3522 - Belgian Ardennes™","Tandoori lamb with pomegranate, Beef Wellington with a red wine jus, Raspberry chocolate torte",Sam Mason,"Extra Pale, Chocolate, Carafa Special Malt Type 3","Tomahawk, Magnum, Magnum, Tomahawk, Centennial, Amarillo, Centennial, Amarillo, Tomahawk",Wyeast 3522 - Belgian Ardennes™

10,Bramling X,Single Hop IPA Series - 2011.,01/2011,"Good old Bramling Cross is elegant, refined, assured, (boring) and understated. Understated that is unless you hop the living daylights out of a beer with it. This is Bramling Cross re-invented and re-imagined, and shows just what can be done with English hops if you use enough of them. Poor Bramling Cross normally gets lost in a woeful stream of conformist brown ales made by sleepy cask ale brewers. But not anymore. This beer shows that British hops do have some soul, and is a fruity riot of blackberries, pears, and plums. Reminds me of the bramble, apple and ginger jam my grandmother used to make.",https://images.punkapi.com/v2/10.png,7.5,75.0,22.0,11.0,4.4,"Extra Pale, Crystal 150, Caramalt Bramling Cross, Bramling Cross Wyeast 1056 - American Ale™","Warm blackberry pie, Vinegar doused fish and chips, Aromatic korma curry with lemon and garlic naan",Sam Mason,"Extra Pale, Crystal 150, Caramalt","Bramling Cross, Bramling Cross",Wyeast 1056 - American Ale™
